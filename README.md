# Online Inspection System

The contents of this project derive from my graduation internship work at Hebei Software Institute, and are based on the real-life requirements and demands of one of the instituteâ€™s customers, JuLi Rigging Co. 
<p> The design of this system is based on a multi-layered B/S (browser-client/server) architecture, the backend using Java  with Spring-boot micro-framework and MySQL, while the front-end uses Html5, Node.js, and Vue.js components.
<p> This system provides the users with online access and management of test data and related functions, such as error handling control, selection of the inspection standards for the captured test data, user access management, test machine management, machine network status management, entrustment order management, and test results report generation. 
<p> Given that this project is part of my graduation thesis, and it's currently in use at JuLi Rigging Co., only some classes and files will be shared in this public repo.
